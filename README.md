# 4229hw2

For this project I use SDL2 and SDL2 TTL.
The required files are arial.ttf, lorenx.cpp, Text.cpp, Text.h

# Operation

You move the view with the left click and the mouse and change the scale with the scroll wheel.
Keybindings:
c - show commands
n- normalize the lorenz coordinates to between -1 and 1
q,a - change the s factor of the lorenz
w,s - change the b factor of the lorenz
e,d - change the r factor of the lorenz
r - reset the lorenz
x- select random values for the lorenz factors NOTE: I would recommend pressing n to normalize first, otherwise the resulting shape will most likely not fit on the screen.
p - play the animation
f - make fullscreen

# Intresting notes

I found it intresting, how as b aproached -infinity, the line appears to aproach z = 0

When r increased, the entire figure got bigger, but as r got smaller it unwound and disapeared.
